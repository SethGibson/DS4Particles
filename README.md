The now infamous "intel blue point cloud and particles visualizer", presented for reference and learning ONLY. This code is not meant to be re-used for other commercial purposes and is presented under that very strict criterion. In other words, people are being very generous by letting me make this source public and I'd like to be able to leave it here so people can learn from it!!
